## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Was great diving deeper of my understanding of Flexbox. Also sorting the css dealing first with styles and then with the layout was something I found usefull for this project.



### Continued development

More work to be done without using media queries. More practices with the possibilities of flexbox.


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox guide, CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Always handy to have this guide to flexbox.
